### Art Piece 1
![Sublimare](images/sublimare-2.jpg?raw=true "Sublimare")
Sublimare is an artistic lighting installation at the San Diego airport.  This piece moves on the wall, swaying and gradually fading new elements in and out.  The juxtaposition between the soft bokeh bubbles and the crisp palm fronds immediately caught my attention.  They create a beautiful balance between the outdoors in California and modern art.  I am truly fascinated by Sublimare because the changing color and light are signaled by the real-time conditions of the San Diego coast.  Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was programmed into the art system, meaning that it would be almost impossible to watch an identical sequence of movement on this display.  This is more interesting to me than viewing a video of the same motions on a loop.  I appreciate the incorporation of nature and reality into this dream-like lighting display.
